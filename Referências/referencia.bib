abstract = {Membrane fouling has been identified by many researchers as an inconvenience for the industrial application of membranes in wastewater treatment plants. Membrane fouling decreases permeability and therefore permeates flow, increasing costs. Although fouling is the result of complex phenomena not completely known, it can be said that fouling takes place by the presence of three different kinds of compounds in the water: suspended solids, colloids and solutes. In this sense, the characteristics of the suspended solid aggregates might be an important aspect in order to diminish the impact of suspended solids on membrane fouling. The main objective of this study was to compare the operation of two similar tertiary membrane filtration units treating the effluent of two different SBRs, respectively: A granular sludge SBR (GSBR) and a membrane flocculent sludge SBR system, at laboratory scale. Two PVDF microfiltration membrane modules were used for tertiary filtration of the effluent treated in the SBRs. Both reactors were used for treating the wastewater generated in a factory of the fish freezing sector. COD of the wastewater was between 700 and 1100 mg/L, total nitrogen concentration was between 110 and 180 mg N/L and total phosphorus ranged around 110 mg P/L. The chemical characteristics of both permeates were similar. Moreover, the presence of either granules or flocs in the tertiary membrane filtration systems did not have an appreciable impact on the membrane filtration. Nevertheless, it was observed that the operation of the membrane on the flocculent system tends to be more instable, showing a major tendency to achieve critical flux. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Balaban Desalination Publications. All rights reserved.The formation of aerobic granules after the treatment of paper mill effluents was feasible. Granular sludge presented a lower fouling potential than flocculent sludge, allowing a higher flux through the membranes in a membrane bioreactor (MBR). However, it was observed that after filtration many of the biogranules disrupted, which increased the membrane fouling. Therefore, the formation of aggregates that are physically and mechanically more resistant to decomposition would be beneficial to an MBR process. This work determines which of the microorganisms found in the aerobic granular sludge contribute to microbial aggregation, thereby increasing the mechanical resistance of aggregates. Nineteen strains were isolated from granular aerobic sludge. Tests for coaggregation showed that some isolates (E2, E7, E9, E13, and E25) were able to improve the formation of granules, while others (E10, E14, E18, and E26) inhibited the aggregation. The extracellular polymeric substances analyses indicated which substances contributed to the granule formation. The mechanical resistance of the aggregates was determined and the results showed that isolate E19 substantially improved the resistance of the aggregates to disruption.},

abstract = {Research from different studies has been used to support three different theories pertaining to the role of cations in bioflocculation. These theories are the alginate theory, Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey, and Overbeek (DLVO) theory, and divalent cation bridging (DCB) theory. The objectives of this research were to examine the role of cations in bioflocculation to determine which theory, if any, best describes cation induced bioflocculation. Experiments were performed using laboratory scale activated sludge systems with bactopeptone as a feed. The feed was supplemented with either calcium, magnesium, or sodium at increasing concentrations. Floc properties were analyzed in each reactor during steady state periods. The addition of calcium or magnesium to the feed individually resulted in improvements in SVI, CST, SRF, cake solids and floc strength and each of these divalent cations produced similar results. The addition of sodium to the feed resulted in a deterioration in floc properties relative to a control reactor. Analysis of these results suggest that the DCB theory best explains the role of cations. The discrepancies between different studies were examined and are thought to be a result of different experimental procedures in different studies and in particular the use of short-term batch tests versus continuous flow reactor studies. In addition, the implications of DCB theory suggests that activated sludge systems should attempt to lower the ratio of monovalent to divalent cations to improve floc properties and treatment performance.

abstract = {Settling velocity is a crucial parameter in granular sludge technology. In this study the effects of temperature and salt concentrations on settling velocities of granular sludge particles were evaluated. A two-fold slower settling velocity for the same granules was observed when the temperature of water decreases from 40 °C to 5 °C. Settling velocities also decreased with increasing salt concentrations. Experiments showed that when granules were not pre-incubated in a solution with increased salt concentration, they initially floated. The time dependent increase in mass and hence in settling speed of a granule due to salt diffusion into the granule was dependent on the granule diameter. The time needed for full salt equilibrium with the bulk liquid took 1 min for small particles from the top of the sludge bed and up to 30 min for big granules from the bottom of the sludge bed. These results suggest that temperature and salt concentration are important parameters to consider in the design, start-up and operation of granular sludge reactors and monitoring of these parameters will aid in a better control of the sludge management in anaerobic and aerobic granular sludge technology. The observations also give an explanation for previous reports which were suggesting that a start-up of granular sludge reactors is more difficult at low temperatures. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A standard flux-step method has been developed for assessing fouling in a membrane bioreactor operating at constant flux. Three keys parameters based on transmembrane pressure (TMP) were derived to depict fouling behaviour and identify the onset of fouling at the so-called critical flux. A zero rate of TMP increase (dP/dt) was never attained during the trial, such that no critical flux, in its strictest definition, could be defined in this study for a submerged MBR challenged with real and synthetic sewage. The three TMP-based parameters all indicated roughly the same flux value at which fouling started to become significant (the weak form of critical flux), this being 10 and 18lm-2h-1 when the MBR was fed with synthetic and real sewage, respectively. Long-term filtration trials featured much lower dP/dt values compared to those obtained during short-term fouling test, but sub-critical flux operation led to a catastrophic increase in fouling rate after some critical time period apparently dependent on feedwater matrix and flux. It was concluded that flux-step determination of the critical flux cannot be used to predict long-term TMP behaviour in real MBR systems, but nonetheless provides useful data on comparative fouling propensity. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Abstract The main objectives of the present study were to investigate the interactions of divalent metals (Ca2+ and Mg2+) with protein and polysaccharide components of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and to deduce their role in imparting different physicochemical characteristics to aerobic granules in sequencing batch reactor (SBR) system. Three reactors were run for 60 days; R-1 functioned as a control reactor, whereas R-2 and R-3 were operated by dosing 25 mg/L of Ca2+ and Mg2+, respectively, and the other operating conditions were similar in all of the SBRs. The granulation rate, particle size and sludge settleability were rapidly increased by Ca2+ addition, whereas the sludge dewaterability was significantly enhanced by Mg2+ augmentation. During the investigations, R-1, R-2 and R-3 had 1.31, 2.98 and 1.58 times higher quantities of polysaccharides, whereas proteins were 1.28, 1.74 and 2.41 times, respectively, more abundant than seed sludge. The divalent metals profoundly changed the composition of EPS, but their total contents were almost similar. XPS and FTIR results showed that Ca2+ bonded strongly with hydroxyl groups of polysaccharides due to there being less steric hindrance than proteins, and Mg2+ preferably bonded with amide groups of proteins and found no such hindrance due to its smaller size and thus changed the composition of EPS, which eventually altered the granular sludge characteristics.},

abstract = {The present study was designed to achieve steady state high membrane flux values by controlling the organic and inorganic foulants during MBR operation. Three granular sludge sequencing batch membrane bioreactors, namely, R-1, R-2 and R-3, were run at a constant flux of 40LMH for 90days. R-1 was operated without the addition of Mg2+, R-2 with a continuous dosage of 50mg/L Mg2+, whereas R-3 was run with stoichiometric amounts of Mg2+ (18–22mg/L) in correlation with SMP contents. The particle sizes of aerobic granules were approximately 725 and 600$\mu$m in R-2 and R-3, respectively, compared with 250$\mu$m in R-1. The ratios of EPS proteins/polysaccharides in R-1, R-2 and R-3 were 1.63, 3.90 and 3.76, respectively, whereas the SMP concentrations in R-1, R-2 and R-3 were 40, 5 and 5mg/L, respectively. The results highlighted that in R-3, the controlled addition of Mg2+ along with the emergence of aerobic granules tremendously increased the membrane permeability, which was approximately 6 and 3 times higher than R-1 and R-2, respectively. In R-3, a molar ratio of 1:2 between Mg2+ and SMP was found to be optimal for the successful sustainability of high flux values during the long term membrane treatment. FTIR, SEM and ICP spectroscopic investigations revealed that the deposition of fine sludge flocs and high amounts of proteins and polysaccharides on the membrane surface in R-1 and Mg2+ in R-2 were mainly responsible for their low permeability.},

abstract = {Over the last 10 years, numerous membrane filtration data have been viewed through the lens of the concept of critical flux. This concept, used in a number of different ways often without explicit redefinition, is here clarified both theoretically and from an experimental viewpoint. A link is made with the concept of sustainable flux and an approach given for the determination of the apparent sustainable flux. To retain the utility of the critical flux concepts, it is emphasised firstly that the strong form and weak form of the critical flux, Jcs and Jcw, must be evaluated via a check on whether or not the overall resistance has remained invariant. Secondly, the critical flux for irreversibility, Jci, has a sound theoretical basis; it represents the shift from repulsive interaction (dispersed matter-polarised layer) to attractive interaction (condensed matter-deposit). The various methods for measuring critical flux and the influence of membrane and suspension properties on critical flux are reviewed. Dispersive forces that are the key to the existence of a critical flux are discussed. The concept of a critical concentration for phase transition is also introduced. For theoreticians and experimentalists, this and the clarified concept of a small set of critical fluxes will continue to provide a valuable framework. But in addition, and especially for membrane users dealing with industrial process streams, the concept of a sustainable flux (which has evolved from critical flux thinking) is of a great utility. Above the sustainable flux (dependent on hydrodynamics, feed conditions and process time), the rate of fouling is economically and environmentally unsustainable. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Biological wastewater treatment by aerobic granular sludge biofilms offers the possibility to combine carbon (COD), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) removal in a single reactor. Since denitrification can be affected by suboptimal dissolved oxygen concentrations (DO) and limited availability of COD, different aeration strategies and COD loads were tested to improve N- and P-removal in granular sludge systems. Aeration strategies promoting alternating nitrification and denitrification (AND) were studied to improve reactor efficiencies in comparison with more classical simultaneous nitrification-denitrification (SND) strategies. With nutrient loading rates of 1.6gCODL-1d-1, 0.2gNL-1d-1, and 0.08gPL-1d-1, and SND aeration strategies, N-removal was limited to 62.3±3.4{\%}. Higher COD loads markedly improved N-removal showing that denitrification was limited by COD. AND strategies were more efficient than SND strategies. Alternating high and low DO phases during the aeration phase increased N-removal to 71.2±5.6{\%} with a COD loading rate of 1.6gCODL-1d-1. Periods of low DO were presumably favorable to denitrifying P-removal saving COD necessary for heterotrophic N-removal. Intermittent aeration with anoxic periods without mixing between the aeration pulses was even more favorable to N-removal, resulting in 78.3±2.9{\%} N-removal with the lowest COD loading rate tested. P-removal was under all tested conditions between 88 and 98{\%}, and was negatively correlated with the concentration of nitrite and nitrate in the effluent (r=-0.74, p{\textless}0.01). With low COD loading rates, important emissions of undesired N2O gas were observed and a total of 7-9{\%} of N left the reactor as N2O. However, N2O emissions significantly decreased with higher COD loads under AND conditions. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},
